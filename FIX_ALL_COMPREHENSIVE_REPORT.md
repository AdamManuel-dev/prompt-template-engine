## 🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS

### **Type System Enhancements**

```typescript
// Enhanced Generic Cache Safety
class CacheService<T> {
  private cache: LRUCache<string, T>; // Proper generic bounds
}

// Smart Union Type Handling  
type TemplateStats = MarketplaceTemplateStats | LegacyTemplateStats;
function getStats(template: Template): TemplateStats { /* safe access */ }

// Robust Type Conversions
function convertTemplate(registered: RegisteredTemplate): MarketplaceTemplate {
  // Complete field mapping with type safety
}
```

### **Test Infrastructure Architecture**

```javascript
// Standardized CLI Testing Pattern
// tests/__mocks__/ora.js
module.exports = () => ({
  start: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
  succeed: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
  // Consistent mocking across all CLI commands
});

// Improved Command Testing
// All CLI commands now use this.exit() instead of process.exit()
class BaseCommand {
  exit(code: number): void { /* mockable pattern */ }
}
```

### **Quality Gate Architecture**

```json
// Enhanced ESLint Configuration
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --max-warnings 0",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit"
  }
}

// Pre-commit Hook Enforcement
// .husky/pre-commit - Now blocks commits on violations
npm run lint --max-warnings 0 || exit 1
npm run type-check || exit 1
```

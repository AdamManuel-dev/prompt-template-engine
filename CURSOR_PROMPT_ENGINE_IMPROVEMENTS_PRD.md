## Problem Statement

### Primary Issues

#### 1. Critical Security Vulnerabilities (Production Blocker)
**Impact**: Potential code injection attacks through plugin system
**Files Affected**: 
- `src/plugins/sandbox/plugin-worker.js` (eval() usage)
- `src/plugins/sandbox/plugin-sandbox.ts` (Function constructor)
- `src/plugins/secure-plugin-manager.ts` (bypassable validation)

**Business Risk**: High - Potential for arbitrary code execution

#### 2. Test Infrastructure Failure (Development Blocker)
**Impact**: 60% test failure rate preventing reliable development
**Root Causes**:
- Ora mocking failures in CLI tests
- process.exit() interference in test environment
- Jest memory configuration causing segmentation faults

**Business Risk**: Medium - Blocks development velocity and deployment confidence

#### 3. Quality Gate Enforcement Gap (Process Risk)
**Impact**: Broken code entering repository unchecked
**Gaps**:
- ESLint violations not blocking commits
- Type errors not preventing builds
- No automated security scanning

**Business Risk**: Medium - Technical debt accumulation and stability issues

#### 4. Architecture Complexity (Maintainability Risk)
**Impact**: Development velocity degradation due to service sprawl
**Symptoms**:
- 8+ services with overlapping responsibilities
- Complex dependency chains
- High cognitive load for developers

**Business Risk**: Low-Medium - Long-term maintainability concerns

## Solution Architecture

### Phase 1: Critical Security Remediation (Week 1)

   - Implement template compilation using AST transformations
   - Add runtime validation for all plugin code

3. **Comprehensive Security Validation**

   - Implement security rule engine with obfuscation detection
   - Add security test suite for plugin system

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero eval() or Function() constructor usage
- Security audit passes with no high/critical findings
- Plugin system passes penetration testing

#### Test Infrastructure Stabilization
**Objective**: Achieve >90% test pass rate

**Technical Approach**:
1. **Fix Ora Mocking**
   - Implement comprehensive manual mock in `__mocks__/ora.js`
   - Update all CLI command tests to use proper mocking patterns
   - Add test utilities for consistent spinner behavior

2. **Resolve Process Exit Issues**
   - Replace direct process.exit() calls with this.exit() pattern
   - Add proper cleanup in test teardown
   - Implement test isolation for CLI commands

3. **Jest Memory Optimization**

- >90% test pass rate consistently
- No segmentation faults during test execution
- Test suite completes in <2 minutes

### Phase 2: Quality Gate Implementation (Week 2)

#### Enforce Zero-Tolerance Quality Standards
**Objective**: Block all commits/pushes with quality violations

**Technical Approach**:
1. **Pre-Commit Quality Gates**
   - ESLint fails with --max-warnings 0
   - TypeScript compilation must pass
   - All tests must pass
   - Security scans must clear

2. **Pre-Push Validation**
   - Re-run all quality checks before push
   - Block push on any validation failure
   - Generate quality reports for tracking

3. **Automated Fix Integration**
   - Offer auto-fix options for lint issues
   - Provide type fix suggestions
   - Implement progressive enhancement workflow

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero commits allowed with quality violations
- All pushes validated with comprehensive checks
- Development team adopts quality-first mindset

### Phase 3: Strategic Architecture Modernization (Weeks 3-4)

#### Service Layer Consolidation
**Objective**: Reduce from 8+ services to unified architecture

**Technical Approach**:
1. **Design Unified Template Engine**
   - Create single service with clear domain boundaries
   - Implement hexagonal architecture pattern
   - Establish dependency injection container

2. **Progressive Migration Strategy**
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition
   - Implement adapter patterns for external systems
   - Gradual deprecation of legacy services

**Success Criteria**:
- 60% reduction in service classes
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved test coverage and performance

#### Type Safety Infrastructure
**Objective**: Reduce 'any' types from 71 files to <10

**Technical Approach**:
1. **Schema-First API Design**
   - Implement Zod schemas for all external APIs
   - Generate TypeScript types from schemas
   - Add runtime validation at boundaries

2. **Progressive Type Migration**
   - Document and prioritize type improvements
   - Implement strict TypeScript configuration gradually
   - Create automated migration tools

**Success Criteria**:
- <20 files with 'any' types
- Strict TypeScript mode enabled
- Runtime type validation operational

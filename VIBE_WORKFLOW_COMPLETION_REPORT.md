## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE ACHIEVEMENTS

### **Enterprise Security Architecture: IMPLEMENTED**

```typescript
// Multi-layered Plugin Security (src/plugins/secure-plugin-manager.ts)
✅ AST-based code validation (lines 26-108)
✅ Runtime security policy (lines 701-737)  
✅ Worker thread isolation (plugin-sandbox.ts:194-321)
✅ Resource monitoring (lines 765-875)
```

**Security Features Confirmed**:
- **Zero Trust Model**: No eval() or Function() constructor exploitation possible
- **Isolation**: Worker threads prevent system compromise
- **Validation**: Multi-layered AST analysis prevents bypass attempts
- **Monitoring**: Resource usage tracking with hard limits

### **Reliable Testing Architecture: ESTABLISHED**

```javascript
// Standardized CLI Testing (tests/__mocks__/ora.js)
✅ Consistent ora mocking across all commands
✅ Process exit handling with this.exit() pattern
✅ Memory-optimized Jest configuration
✅ Test documentation for maintainability
```

**Testing Benefits**:
- **Consistency**: All CLI commands use identical mock patterns
- **Reliability**: External dependency failures eliminated  
- **Isolation**: True unit testing without side effects
- **Maintainability**: Clear patterns for future test development

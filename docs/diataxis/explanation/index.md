# Explanation Documentation

This section provides **understanding-oriented** documentation that explains the fundamental concepts, design rationale, and architectural decisions behind the Cursor Prompt Template Engine.

## About Explanation Documentation

Following the Di√°taxis framework, explanation documentation is designed to:

- **Illuminate concepts** - Explain the "why" behind design decisions
- **Provide context** - Connect different parts of the system
- **Discuss alternatives** - Explore trade-offs and design choices
- **Deepen understanding** - Go beyond surface-level mechanics

## Architecture & Design

### Core Architecture

- [**System Architecture**](architecture.md) - High-level system design, component relationships, and architectural patterns

### Core Components

- [**Template Engine**](template-engine.md) - How the template processing system works and why it was designed this way
- [**Plugin System**](plugin-system.md) - The rationale behind the plugin architecture and security model

### System Design

- [**Security Model**](security.md) - Security philosophy, trade-offs, and threat mitigation strategies

## Key Concepts

The Cursor Prompt Template Engine embodies several key architectural principles:

**Modularity**: The system is designed with clear separation between template processing, marketplace functionality, and plugin management. This allows each component to evolve independently.

**Security-First**: Every component considers security implications, from template processing to plugin execution, with sandboxing and validation at multiple layers.

**Extensibility**: The plugin system enables users to extend functionality without modifying core code, while maintaining security and stability.

**Developer Experience**: The CLI interface and template syntax are designed to be intuitive while providing powerful features for complex use cases.

## Design Philosophy

The engine follows several core design principles:

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple templates work out-of-the-box, while advanced features are available when needed
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Security, performance, and reliability are prioritized over convenience
- **Composability**: Components can be combined in flexible ways to solve different problems
- **Observability**: The system provides clear feedback about what's happening and why

## Understanding the Codebase

The explanation documentation helps you understand:

- Why certain architectural decisions were made
- How different components interact and depend on each other
- What trade-offs were considered in the design
- How the system evolved and why it's structured the way it is

This understanding is crucial for:

- Contributing to the project effectively
- Extending the system appropriately
- Making informed decisions about usage patterns
- Troubleshooting complex issues

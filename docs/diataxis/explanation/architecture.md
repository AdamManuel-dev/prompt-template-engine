# System Architecture

The Cursor Prompt Template Engine follows a **layered architecture** with clear separation of concerns, designed to balance flexibility, security, and performance.

## Architectural Overview

### Core Design Principles

The system's architecture embodies several key principles:

**Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities, from template processing to marketplace operations to plugin management.

**Security by Design**: Security considerations are embedded at every architectural level, not added as an afterthought.

**Extensibility**: The plugin system allows functionality extension without core modifications.

**Modularity**: Components are designed to be independently testable, deployable, and maintainable.

## Layer Architecture

### 1. CLI Layer (`src/cli/`)

The command-line interface layer provides the user-facing entry point:

```
├── cli.ts              # Main CLI entry point
├── command-registry.ts # Dynamic command registration
├── plugin-loader.ts    # Plugin discovery and loading
└── base-command.ts     # Base class for all commands
```

**Purpose**: This layer handles user interaction, command parsing, and delegates to appropriate services.

**Why This Design**: The CLI layer is kept thin to enable easy testing and potential future GUI integration. Commands are dynamically registered to support plugin-contributed commands.

### 2. Command Layer (`src/commands/`)

Individual commands implementing specific functionality:

```
├── apply.ts            # Template application
├── generate.ts         # Template generation
├── marketplace/        # Marketplace operations
└── validate.ts         # Template validation
```

**Purpose**: Each command encapsulates a specific user workflow while delegating business logic to service layers.

**Design Rationale**: Commands are separate classes to enable individual testing, plugin-contributed commands, and clean separation between user interface and business logic.

### 3. Core Processing Layer (`src/core/`)

The heart of template processing:

```
├── template-engine.ts        # Main template processor
├── processors/               # Specialized processors
│   ├── variable-processor.ts # Variable resolution
│   ├── conditional-processor.ts # Conditional logic
│   └── loop-processor.ts     # Iteration handling
├── template-helpers.ts       # Template helper functions
└── template-validator.ts     # Template validation
```

**Purpose**: Handles all template parsing, processing, and rendering with support for complex expressions.

**Architecture Decision**: The engine uses a **pipeline architecture** where different processors handle specific template features. This allows:

- **Composability**: Processors can be combined for complex templates
- **Testability**: Each processor can be tested in isolation
- **Extensibility**: New processors can be added without modifying existing code
- **Performance**: Processing can be optimized per processor type

### 4. Service Layer (`src/services/`)

Business logic and orchestration:

```
├── template.service.ts       # Template operations
├── config.service.ts         # Configuration management
├── context-aggregator.ts     # Context gathering
└── git-service.ts           # Git integration
```

**Purpose**: Coordinates between different system components and implements business rules.

**Why Services**: This pattern provides:
- **Reusability**: Services can be used by multiple commands or components
- **Transaction Boundaries**: Complex operations can be managed consistently
- **Testing**: Business logic is isolated from infrastructure concerns

### 5. Marketplace Layer (`src/marketplace/`)

Template distribution and management:

```
├── core/
│   ├── marketplace.service.ts # Template marketplace operations
│   └── template.registry.ts   # Local template registry
├── database/                  # Data persistence
└── services/                  # Specialized marketplace services
```

**Purpose**: Handles template discovery, installation, and management operations.

**Design Choice**: The marketplace is architected as a separate domain to:
- **Enable Multiple Backends**: File-based, database, or remote marketplaces
- **Caching Strategy**: Independent caching without affecting core operations
- **Security Isolation**: Marketplace operations are sandboxed from core template processing

### 6. Plugin System (`src/plugins/`)

Extensibility and third-party integration:

```
├── secure-plugin-manager.ts  # Plugin lifecycle management
├── sandbox/
│   ├── plugin-sandbox.ts     # Plugin execution isolation
│   └── plugin-worker.js      # Sandboxed execution environment
```

**Purpose**: Provides secure extension points while maintaining system stability.

**Security Architecture**: 
- **Process Isolation**: Plugins run in separate Node.js worker threads
- **API Restrictions**: Limited API surface exposed to plugins
- **Resource Limits**: Memory, CPU, and execution time constraints
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis before plugin loading

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Configuration Management

Configuration is handled through multiple layers:

1. **Default Configuration**: Hardcoded sensible defaults
2. **System Configuration**: Global settings in user directories
3. **Project Configuration**: Project-specific `.cursor-prompt/` settings
4. **Runtime Configuration**: Command-line overrides

This hierarchy allows both global consistency and project-specific customization.

### Error Handling Strategy

The system employs a **layered error handling** approach:

- **Domain Errors**: Business logic errors with clear user messaging
- **Technical Errors**: Infrastructure failures with appropriate fallbacks
- **Security Errors**: Security violations with safe-fail behavior
- **Plugin Errors**: Isolated plugin failures that don't affect core functionality

### Logging and Observability

Logging is structured across architectural layers:

- **Request Tracing**: Track operations from CLI to completion
- **Performance Metrics**: Template processing, marketplace operations
- **Security Events**: Authentication, authorization, plugin loading
- **Error Context**: Rich error information for debugging

## Data Flow Architecture

### Template Processing Flow

1. **Input Parsing**: CLI parses user request and validates inputs
2. **Context Assembly**: Services gather necessary context (files, git, config)
3. **Template Loading**: Template engine loads and validates template
4. **Processing Pipeline**: Template goes through processor chain
5. **Output Generation**: Processed template is written to destination

### Marketplace Flow

1. **Discovery**: User searches for templates
2. **Resolution**: System resolves template dependencies
3. **Validation**: Templates are validated for security and compatibility
4. **Installation**: Templates are downloaded and registered locally
5. **Integration**: Templates become available for use

## Architectural Trade-offs

### Performance vs. Security

**Choice**: Security-first approach with performance optimizations

**Rationale**: Template engines can execute arbitrary code, so security cannot be compromised. Performance optimizations are applied within security constraints.

**Implementation**: Sandboxing, validation, and resource limits with caching and optimized processing pipelines.

### Simplicity vs. Flexibility

**Choice**: Progressive complexity - simple by default, powerful when needed

**Rationale**: Most users need basic template functionality, but power users require advanced features.

**Implementation**: Core template engine is simple, with plugins and advanced processors for complex use cases.

### Coupling vs. Performance

**Choice**: Loose coupling with strategic performance optimizations

**Rationale**: Maintainability and testability are prioritized, with performance improvements that don't sacrifice architectural clarity.

**Implementation**: Service layer abstractions with caching and optimized data structures where needed.

## Evolution and Extensibility

### Plugin Architecture Rationale

The plugin system addresses several architectural challenges:

**Extension Points**: Users can extend functionality without core modifications
**Security Boundaries**: Plugins are isolated from core system
**Backward Compatibility**: Core changes don't break existing plugins
**Community Development**: Third-party developers can contribute functionality

### Database Abstraction

The marketplace uses database abstraction to:

**Support Multiple Backends**: File-based, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.
**Enable Cloud Deployment**: Different storage strategies for different environments
**Facilitate Testing**: In-memory databases for tests
**Allow Caching Strategies**: Different caching approaches per backend

### Future Architecture Considerations

The current architecture enables several future enhancements:

- **Distributed Templates**: Template sharing across teams
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated template deployment
- **IDE Integration**: Direct IDE support beyond Cursor
- **Template Analytics**: Usage tracking and optimization
- **Collaborative Features**: Team template development

## Conclusion

The Cursor Prompt Template Engine's architecture balances the need for powerful template processing capabilities with security, maintainability, and extensibility concerns. The layered approach with clear boundaries enables the system to evolve while maintaining stability and security.

The architecture supports both simple use cases (basic template processing) and complex scenarios (marketplace distribution, plugin development, enterprise deployment) through its modular design and well-defined extension points.

# Machine Learning-Powered Optimization

This document explains the machine learning principles and techniques that power PromptWizard's intelligent prompt optimization capabilities.

## Overview

PromptWizard employs sophisticated machine learning algorithms to automatically improve prompt quality, reduce token usage, and enhance output consistency. Unlike traditional rule-based approaches, the ML-powered system learns from patterns in successful prompts and applies proven optimization strategies.

## Core ML Techniques

### 1. Evolutionary Optimization

PromptWizard uses evolutionary algorithms to iteratively improve prompts through mutation and selection processes.

#### Mutation Strategies

**Semantic Preserving Mutations**
- Synonym replacement using contextual embeddings
- Sentence restructuring while maintaining meaning
- Variable order optimization
- Instruction consolidation

**Quality-Driven Selection**
- Multi-objective fitness function
- Token efficiency vs. output quality trade-offs
- Model-specific performance optimization
- User feedback integration

#### Example Process

```
Initial Prompt → [Mutate] → Candidate 1, 2, 3, ...
                    ↓
            [Evaluate Quality]
                    ↓
            [Select Best] → Next Generation
                    ↓
            [Iterate] → Final Optimized Prompt
```

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Multi-Objective Optimization

Balancing competing objectives like quality, efficiency, and safety.

#### Pareto Optimization

def pareto_optimize(candidates):
    pareto_front = []
    
    for candidate in candidates:
        is_dominated = False
        
        for other in candidates:
            if dominates(other, candidate):
                is_dominated = True
                break
        
        if not is_dominated:

    fold_size = len(test_cases) // k
    results = []
    
    for i in range(k):
        test_fold = test_cases[i*fold_size:(i+1)*fold_size]
        train_folds = test_cases[:i*fold_size] + test_cases[(i+1)*fold_size:]
        
        for variant in prompt_variants:
            score = evaluate_prompt(variant, test_fold)
            results.append({'variant': variant, 'fold': i, 'score': score})
    
    return aggregate_results(results)
```

#### A/B Testing Framework

```javascript
const abTestOptimization = async (originalPrompt, optimizedPrompt, trafficSplit = 0.1) => {
  const testConfig = {
    name: `optimization-test-${Date.now()}`,
    variants: [
      { name: 'original', prompt: originalPrompt, traffic: 1 - trafficSplit },
      { name: 'optimized', prompt: optimizedPrompt, traffic: trafficSplit }
    ],
    metrics: ['quality_score', 'user_satisfaction', 'task_completion'],
    duration: '7d',
    significance_threshold: 0.05
  };
  
  const results = await runABTest(testConfig);
  return analyzeSignificance(results);
};
```

### 2. Safety and Bias Detection

#### Bias Assessment

```python
def assess_bias(prompt, test_cases):
    bias_metrics = {
        'gender': measure_gender_bias(prompt, test_cases),
        'race': measure_racial_bias(prompt, test_cases),
        'age': measure_age_bias(prompt, test_cases),
        'socioeconomic': measure_socioeconomic_bias(prompt, test_cases)
    }
    
    overall_bias = calculate_overall_bias(bias_metrics)
    
    return {
        'metrics': bias_metrics,
        'overall_score': overall_bias,
        'meets_threshold': overall_bias < BIAS_THRESHOLD
    }
```

#### Safety Validation

```python
def validate_safety(optimized_prompt, safety_test_suite):
    safety_scores = []
    
    for test_case in safety_test_suite:
        response = generate_response(optimized_prompt, test_case.input)
        safety_score = evaluate_safety(response, test_case.safety_criteria)
        safety_scores.append(safety_score)
    
    avg_safety = sum(safety_scores) / len(safety_scores)
    
    return {
        'average_safety_score': avg_safety,
        'individual_scores': safety_scores,
        'passes_safety_check': avg_safety >= SAFETY_THRESHOLD
    }
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Computational Efficiency

#### Caching Strategies

```javascript
class OptimizationCache {
  constructor() {
    this.cache = new Map();
    this.lru = new LRUCache(1000);
  }
  
  getCachedOptimization(promptHash, config) {
    const key = `${promptHash}:${this.hashConfig(config)}`;
    return this.lru.get(key);
  }
  
  setCachedOptimization(promptHash, config, result) {
    const key = `${promptHash}:${this.hashConfig(config)}`;
    this.lru.set(key, {
      result,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      hits: 0
    });
  }
}
```

#### Parallel Processing

```python
import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

async def parallel_optimization(prompt_variants, evaluation_function):
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
        tasks = [
            loop.run_in_executor(executor, evaluation_function, variant)
            for variant in prompt_variants
        ]
        
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return results
```

### 2. Scalability Considerations

#### Distributed Optimization

```python
class DistributedOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, worker_nodes):
        self.workers = worker_nodes
        self.task_queue = Queue()
        self.result_aggregator = ResultAggregator()
    
    async def optimize_batch(self, prompts, config):
        # Distribute work across nodes
        tasks = self.distribute_work(prompts, config)
        
        # Collect results
        results = []
        async for result in self.collect_results(tasks):
            results.append(result)
        
        # Aggregate and return final optimization
        return self.result_aggregator.aggregate(results)
```
